Back In Action
==============

Wow it's been a while since I created a post. I have been busy with the day to day of mobile dev. I have also been
organizing the local Unity group.  Never feeling like I am where I want to be with my skills or my own company.

I have decided to refocus my self and the company.  I plan to focus more on game development and mobile development.

To this end, I plan on starting the 30DayDev_ Challenge. I will start posting the game projects here.

I have also started trying to sharpen my drawing skills.  It's been a while.  This used to be one of my passions before
work consumed most of my life.  I want to get back to that again.  I think this is for another blog post later.

Catch you on the flip side
