Cross Platform Game Development
===============================

I have started working on a new Hobby.  Trying to develop a game.  This has been somthing I have wanted to do for a long time.  

Recently I found a library I like called Cocos2d-X.  It is a C++ game framework that can be uesd for cross platform game dev.  I have written my first test case already.  I like it.
