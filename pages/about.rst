With a passion for Mobile Development, Allan Davis has been focused on native development for iOS and Android for the past couple of years.   Allan began his career in 1996 while learning basic programming.  Feeling the urge to delve deeper, Allan became certified in Java as a developer and along the way was instrumental in Python development with NetBeans.  He honed his talents with Objective C, and Ruby on Rails.  Allan has long been driven to share his knowledge and offers several classes each year in Mobile and Web Development and has an online video series for Android, iOS and Ruby on Rails applications.
